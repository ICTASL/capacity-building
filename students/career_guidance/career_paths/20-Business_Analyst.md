# 20. Business Analyst

* **Role Definition & Responsibilities:**
     * **Definition:** Business Analysts are professionals who bridge the gap between business needs and IT solutions. They analyze organizational systems and processes, document requirements, and propose solutions to improve efficiency, effectiveness, and business value.  The role often overlaps with that of a **Systems Analyst**, particularly when focusing on IT-related business problems and solutions.  While a Business Analyst might have a broader business process focus, a Systems Analyst usually concentrates on analyzing, designing, and implementing IT systems to meet business needs. In practice, many roles combine aspects of both, requiring skills in business process analysis, requirements engineering, and IT solution design.  Business Analysts are essential for ensuring that IT projects align with business goals and deliver real value to the organization.
          
     * **Responsibilities:**
       
        * **Requirements Elicitation and Analysis:**  Gathering, documenting, and analyzing business requirements from stakeholders through interviews, workshops, surveys, and document analysis. Understanding the underlying business needs and translating them into clear, concise, and testable requirements.
        * **Process Modeling and Analysis:**  Analyzing current business processes, identifying inefficiencies and areas for improvement, and modeling future "to-be" processes using process flow diagrams, use cases, and other modeling techniques.
        * **System Analysis and Design (Systems Analyst aspect):**  Analyzing existing IT systems, identifying system gaps and improvement opportunities, and designing new or enhanced IT systems to meet business requirements. This may involve defining system architecture, data flows, user interfaces, and system integrations.
        * **Feasibility Studies and Solution Evaluation:**  Conducting feasibility studies to assess the viability of proposed solutions. Evaluating different solution options, including vendor solutions, custom development, or process changes, and recommending the most appropriate solution based on business needs, technical feasibility, and cost-benefit analysis.
        * **Requirements Documentation and Management:** Creating and maintaining requirements documentation, including business requirements documents (BRDs), functional requirements specifications (FRSs), user stories, use cases, and data dictionaries. Managing requirements throughout the project lifecycle, ensuring traceability and managing changes effectively.
