    * Backend: Node.js with Express (JavaScript), Python with Django or Flask, Java with Spring Boot, Ruby on Rails, .NET Core. API testing tools (Postman, Insomnia).
    * Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB. ORM/ODM libraries (e.g., Sequelize, Mongoose).
    * Tools: Git, Docker, npm/yarn/pip/maven, VS Code (or other IDEs), command-line interface, cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) for deployment and services. Open-source tools are widely available and encouraged.

    * Typical Job Titles: Junior Full Stack Developer, Associate Software Engineer, Full Stack Development Trainee, Web Developer Intern.
    * Common Responsibilities:
        * Writing code under supervision and guidance.
        * Implementing well-defined features.
        * Participating in code reviews.
        * Testing and debugging basic components.
        * Assisting senior developers with more complex tasks.
    * Expected Initial Salary Ranges: Varies greatly by location and company. Generalized ranges could be:
        * US: $50,000 - $80,000 per year (depending on location and experience).
        * Europe: €30,000 - €50,000 per year (Western Europe, varies greatly in Eastern Europe).
        * India: ₹3 LPA - ₹6 LPA (major metro areas).
        * Note: These are very generalized estimates. Research local market conditions is crucial.

    * Project Ideas:
        * Personal Blog: Demonstrates frontend (UI, content display) and backend (user authentication, content management, database interaction) skills.
        * E-commerce Mini-Site: Showcases product listing, shopping cart, order processing (frontend and backend).
        * Task Management App: Real-time updates, user roles, task assignment (frontend and backend with real-time features).
        * API-Driven Projects: Build a frontend that consumes a public API and displays data in a user-friendly way (shows API interaction and frontend skills). Create your own API with a simple backend (demonstrates backend and API development).
        * Open-Source Contributions: Contributing to existing projects demonstrates collaboration and real-world coding experience.
        * Hackathons: Participation and project submission demonstrates ability to work under pressure and learn new technologies quickly.
